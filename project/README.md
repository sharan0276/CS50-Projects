We developed a web-based application 'CRUX' that provides users with utilities such as To-Do lists, calculator and countdown timer.
CRUX supports multiple users. Users can keep their tasks/notes organized with the help CRUX.

How to use?

All you have to do is register, and login to CRUX. You'll be redirected to the homepage of CRUX. You can use the navigation bar on the top of the page to use tools such as calculator, countdown timer and To-Do lists. You can add notes to your pinboard using To-Do lists, perfrom a quick calculation or start a timer.

Using To-Do list:
You can click the '+' icon to add a new task/note to your pinboard.

Using Calculator:

CRUX has an arithmetic calculator that performs all basic arithmetic operations. You are provided with buttons for every operation and digits to perform any operation on the operands provided.

Using countdown timer:
Enter the duration you want to count in the specified format and click the 'Start' button to start the timer. You can reset the timer by clicking on the 'Reset' button.
